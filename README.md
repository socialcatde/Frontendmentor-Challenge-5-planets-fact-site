# Planets Facts Site - A Challenge from frontendmentor.io

For this website project I'll use Javascript, HTML and CSS. For the first time I'll also use a static site generator. I've chosen Eleventy, because it seems to be one of the more popular ones. As a templating language I've chosen EJS because it's JavaScript and I've worked with it before.
